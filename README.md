# i3blocklets
This repository contains the bash scripts which I use with [i3blocks](https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks).

## Dependencies
To use these scripts, the following dependencies need to be satisfied:
* pamixer - [cdemoulins/pamixer](https://github.com/cdemoulins/pamixer)
* playerctl - [acrisci/playerctl](https://github.com/acrisci/playerctl)

> Some additional fonts might be required to render the unicode emojis.

## Usage
Refer to my `i3blocks.conf` file for the usage of these blocklets: [i3blocks.conf](https://github.com/UtkarshVerma/dotfiles/blob/master/i3/i3blocks.conf)
